json-rpc
========

Fully-featured JSON-RPC 2.0 library for Haskell programs.

This JSON-RPC library is fully-compatible with JSON-RPC 2.0 and 1.0. It
provides an interface that combines a JSON-RPC client and server. It can
set and keep track of request ids to parse responses.  There is support
for sending and receiving notifications. You may use any underlying
transport.  Basic TCP client and server provided.

A JSON-RPC application using this interface is considered to be
peer-to-peer, as it can send and receive all types of JSON-RPC message
independent of whether it originated the connection.
